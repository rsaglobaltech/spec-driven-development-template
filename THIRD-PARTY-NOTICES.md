# Third-party notices

Code and data from other projects that ships **inside** this repository rather
than arriving as a dependency. Dependencies are covered by
`csda license-check`, which reads the SBOM; this file exists for the things an
SBOM cannot see because they were copied in.

---

## Gherkin keyword table — `packages/core/src/domain/GherkinDialects.ts`

The keyword table for the `en`, `es` and `pt` dialects is copied verbatim from
`gherkin-languages.json` in [`@cucumber/gherkin`](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin),
and generated from the installed package rather than transcribed.

**Why it is vendored rather than depended on:** `package.json` declares no
runtime dependencies. The CLI runs through `npx` on other people's machines, so
that is a structural promise, and `AI_RULES.md` requires an ADR to add a runtime
dependency. Reading three dialects did not justify one.

**How it is kept honest:** `packages/core/test/unit/gherkin-dialects.test.ts`
compares every vendored entry against the installed official table and fails on
any divergence, and `tests/unit/gherkin-differential.test.ts` compares this
repository's parser against `@cucumber/gherkin` itself over every Gherkin file
shipped here. `@cucumber/gherkin` remains a devDependency so both can run.
