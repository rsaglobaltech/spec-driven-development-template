# 📖 How-to guide

Step-by-step recipes for the most common workflows with `create-spec-driven-app`.
Each recipe is **self-contained** — copy/paste should work end-to-end.

> Prerequisites: **Node.js ≥ 20**, `git`, a shell. All recipes use `csda` (a short alias the package installs for `create-spec-driven-app`) and pin to a published version for reproducible CI.

> **Auto-detect project root**: every command that operates on a project (`plan`, `done`, `validate`, `specops *`) accepts `--project-dir <path>` but **also walks up from your current directory** looking for `spec.md`, `.specops.lock`, or `specops.config.yaml`. Run any of them from inside your project tree without flags.

> **Where do I start?** Pick your adoption level: **L1** specs in the repo
> (recipes 0–3), **L2** CI gate (recipes 4–5), **L3** versioned domain packs
> (recipes 6–10), **L4** agent-driven delivery (recipes 11–12 + the
> [harness spec](specs/harness.md)). Each level stands on its own.

## 0. Adopt SDD on an existing repository

**Goal:** the brownfield path (L1) — install specs, rules and the traceability
matrix on a codebase that already exists, without touching a line of code.

```bash
cd your-existing-repo

# Detects the stack from pom.xml / build.gradle / package.json / go.mod
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest adopt

# Passes immediately — the generated baseline REQ-001 anchors the matrix
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest validate .
```

What `adopt` writes (and only if the file does not already exist):

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `spec.md` | Requirement sections; seeded with REQ-001 "existing behaviour is preserved". |
| `AI_RULES.md` | Agent/human rulebook with your detected stack and test command. |
| `features/adoption/baseline.feature` | Baseline Gherkin scenario pinning the adoption invariant. |
| `docs/specs/traceability.md` | Rich matrix with the baseline row. |
| `docs/specs/adr/README.md` | ADR index for future decisions. |

Override anything the detection got wrong with `--var`:

```bash
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest adopt \
  --var DOMAIN="health information exchange" \
  --var TEST_CMD="./mvnw -B verify"
```

Then retro-fill real requirements one at a time (recipe 2) and lock the gate
in CI (recipes 4–5).

---

## 1. Generate your first project

**Goal:** scaffold a new repo with `spec.md`, `AI_RULES.md`, `docs/specs/`, an empty `features/` directory, and a traceability matrix.

```bash
# 1. Start from the shipped example
cp examples/project.config.example /tmp/acme-energy-hub.config

# 2. Edit /tmp/acme-energy-hub.config — minimum keys:
#   PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_SLUG, PROJECT_TYPE, DOMAIN, STACK, API_STYLE, TESTING

# 3. Scaffold
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest init \
  --config /tmp/acme-energy-hub.config \
  --out /tmp

# 4. Verify
tree /tmp/acme-energy-hub -L 2
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Print every file that would be written; don't touch disk. |
| `--force` | Overwrite a pre-existing target directory. |
| `--no-git` | Skip `git init` (defaults to initialising). |

---

## 2. Replace the scaffold with real requirements

**Goal:** turn the template `spec.md` and `traceability.md` into project-specific content.

1. Open `spec.md`. Replace every placeholder paragraph; keep the `REQ-NNN` heading convention because the validator uses it.
2. Update `docs/specs/traceability.md`. Use the rich 10-column header if you want full DDD coverage; the legacy 4-column form is also accepted.
3. Each `REQ-NNN` you add to `spec.md` must appear in `traceability.md` and (eventually) in a `.feature` file. `validate` flags missing rows; `validate --strict-tdd` also flags missing scenarios/tests.

> Tip: keep `AI_RULES.md` open in your editor. It is what every coding agent reads on every prompt — changes there propagate to Claude/Cursor/Aider without re-prompting.

---

## 3. Add a Gherkin scenario and keep traceability green

**Goal:** add a feature file and register it in the matrix so `validate` stays green.

```bash
# 1. Create the feature
mkdir -p features/billing
cat > features/billing/discounts.feature <<'EOF'
Feature: Apply discount on checkout
  Scenario: Premium customer receives 10% discount
    Given a logged-in premium customer
    When they checkout with an order of 100 EUR
    Then the final price is 90 EUR
EOF

# 2. Add a row to docs/specs/traceability.md (rich header shown below)
#    | REQ-007 | SCN-007 | features/billing/discounts.feature | UC-007 | ApplyDiscountCommand | CartAggregate | DiscountApplied | DiscountService.java | DiscountServiceTest | Draft |

# 3. Validate
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest validate .
```

If the new `.feature` is not in `traceability.md`, the validator exits with a non-zero status and tells you the missing file.

---

## 4. Run `validate` locally and in CI

**Goal:** make `validate` part of every PR.

Local:

```bash
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest validate .
```

GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/specs.yml
name: Spec validation
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: npx --yes create-spec-driven-app@latest validate .
```

What `validate` checks:

- required directories (`features/`, `docs/specs/`),
- required files (`spec.md`, `AI_RULES.md`, `traceability.md`, ADR entrypoint),
- at least one `.feature`,
- no unresolved `{{...}}` placeholders,
- traceability matrix header presence,
- every `.feature` appears in `traceability.md`,
- allowed traceability statuses,
- duplicate `Scenario ID` detection,
- expected `use-cases.md` and `events.md` headers when those files exist.

Exit codes: `0` ok · `1` unhandled · `2` usage · `3` missing prerequisite · `4` destination conflict.

---

## 5. Enforce TDD with `validate --strict-tdd`

**Goal:** fail PRs when a `REQ` exists in `spec.md` but has no scenario, no implementing test, or no row in `traceability.md`.

```bash
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest validate . --strict-tdd
```

`--strict-tdd` is in addition to the normal checks. It is intended for "no contract without a test" gates — particularly useful in `contracts` packs (see §8). Wire it into CI exactly like `validate`, just append the flag.

> When a `REQ` is intentionally not yet implemented, set its status in `traceability.md` to `Deferred` — `--strict-tdd` accepts that as an explicit signal and won't fail.

---

## 6. Author a domain pack from scratch

**Goal:** package a reusable bundle of requirements, use cases, aggregates, events, and Gherkin templates.

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a pack
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest pack init \
  --out ./domain-packs \
  --name "Billing Backend" \
  --type backend

# 2. Edit ./domain-packs/billing/backend/pack.yaml
#    Required fields (see schemas/pack.schema.json for the full schema):
#      schema_version, metadata.{name,version,language,project_type}
#      variables.required
#    Optional: requirements, use_cases, commands, aggregates, events,
#              scenarios, outputs.files, rules

# 3. Lint
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest pack lint \
  --pack-root ./domain-packs \
  --pack billing/backend
```

Minimum viable `pack.yaml`:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../../schemas/pack.schema.json
schema_version: "1.2.0"
metadata:
  name: "Billing Backend"
  version: "0.1.0"
  language: "en"
  project_type: "backend"
variables:
  required: [PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_SLUG, DOMAIN]
requirements:
  - id: REQ-001
    title: "Charge customer at checkout"
    priority: Must
    status: Draft
outputs:
  files:
    - target: "features/billing/charge.feature"
      template: |
        Feature: Charge customer at checkout
          Scenario: Successful payment for {{PROJECT_NAME}}
            Given a valid card on file
            When the user confirms the order
            Then a CHARGE event is emitted
```

`pack lint` blocks publication on schema violations, missing requirements, unresolved placeholders, and duplicate IDs.

---

## 7. Apply a domain pack to an existing project

**Goal:** layer a pack onto a project generated in §1, supplying its template variables.

The recommended ergonomic path is `specops add` (npm-install-style):

```bash
# From inside your project (auto-detected project dir)
csda specops add \
  --pack-repo https://github.com/acme/billing-specops.git \
  --pack-version v0.1.0 \
  --pack backend \
  --var PROJECT_NAME="Acme Energy Hub" \
  --var PROJECT_SLUG=acme-energy-hub \
  --var DOMAIN="community energy"
```

`add` writes/updates `.specops.lock` so subsequent `specops sync` / `specops diff` calls remember the source, version, and vars.

Lower-level alternative (`expand`) — same behaviour, more flags:

```bash
csda expand \
  --pack-root ./domain-packs \
  --pack billing/backend \
  --project-dir /tmp/acme-energy-hub \
  --var PROJECT_NAME="Acme Energy Hub" \
  --var PROJECT_SLUG=acme-energy-hub \
  --var DOMAIN="community energy"
```

To take a pack OFF the project:

```bash
csda specops remove parking-management/backend
```

> `remove` drops the entry from `.specops.lock` but does **not** delete generated files — you might have hand-edited tests pointing at them. Use `git status` afterwards and clean up by hand.

Side effects:

- New `.feature` files under `features/`.
- New rows in `docs/specs/traceability.md`.
- Rich-DDD docs (`use-cases.md`, `aggregates.md`, …) populated/extended.
- A `.specops.lock` file at the project root recording **pack repo, version, and the vars you passed**. Commit this file.

Flags:

| Flag | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Print actions without writing. |
| `--no-examples` | Skip files marked `seed: true` (good for production projects). |
| `--cache-dir <path>` | Override the cache directory for remote packs. |

---

## 8. Build a `contracts` pack for API-first work

**Goal:** ship a pack that defines REST/AsyncAPI contracts and consumer-driven Pact tests.

Set `project_type: contracts` in `pack.yaml`. The schema then accepts two extra top-level fields:

- `api_contracts` — list of `{id, title, type, provider, consumers[], schema_ref, requirement}` entries.
- `consumer_driven_tests` — list of `{id, consumer, provider, pact_file, requirement}` entries.

Example excerpt:

```yaml
schema_version: "1.2.0"
metadata:
  name: "API Contracts Pack"
  version: "0.1.0"
  project_type: "contracts"
variables:
  required: [PROJECT_NAME, PROVIDER_SERVICE, CONSUMER_SERVICE]

api_contracts:
  - id: AC-001
    title: "Provider REST API — v1"
    type: REST
    provider: "{{PROVIDER_SERVICE}}"
    consumers: ["{{CONSUMER_SERVICE}}"]
    schema_ref: "contracts/openapi/provider-v1.yaml"
    requirement: REQ-001

consumer_driven_tests:
  - id: CDT-001
    consumer: "{{CONSUMER_SERVICE}}"
    provider: "{{PROVIDER_SERVICE}}"
    pact_file: "contracts/pacts/{{CONSUMER_SERVICE}}-{{PROVIDER_SERVICE}}.json"
    requirement: REQ-002
```

When applied with `expand`, a `contracts` pack generates `docs/specs/test-strategy.md` describing the TDD gates (failing pact = failing build, breaking-change rules, contract versioning policy). Pair it with `validate --strict-tdd` so every `AC-NNN` must trace to a `CDT-NNN` and a `.feature`.

Browse [`packs/sample-contracts/contracts/pack.yaml`](../packs/sample-contracts/contracts/pack.yaml) for a complete working example.

---

## 9. Compose multiple packs with `specops.config.yaml`

**Goal:** declare every pack a project depends on in one place, so a fresh clone can rebuild specs with `specops sync`.

Create `specops.config.yaml` at the project root:

```yaml
specops_version: 1
packs:
  - repo: https://github.com/acme/parking-specops.git
    version: v0.1.0
    pack_id: backend
    vars:
      PROJECT_NAME: Smart Parking
      PROJECT_SLUG: smart-parking
      DOMAIN: parking operations
  - repo: https://github.com/acme/billing-specops.git
    version: v0.2.0
    pack_id: contracts
    vars:
      PROJECT_NAME: Smart Parking
      PROVIDER_SERVICE: billing-svc
      CONSUMER_SERVICE: parking-svc
```

Then on a fresh clone:

```bash
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest specops sync --project-dir .
```

When `.specops.lock` is absent, `sync` reads `specops.config.yaml`, expands every listed pack, and writes the lockfile. When the lockfile exists, the lockfile wins — `specops.config.yaml` is the **intent**, the lockfile is the **resolved state** (think `package.json` vs `package-lock.json`).

---

## 10. Bump a pack version safely (`specops diff` + `sync`)

**Goal:** upgrade `parking-management/backend` from `v0.1.0` to `v0.2.0` without surprises.

```bash
# 1. Preview the change (no writes)
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest specops diff \
  --project-dir ./smart-parking \
  --pack parking-management/backend \
  --pack-version v0.2.0

# Output:
# ── parking-management/backend @ v0.2.0 (current: v0.1.0) ──
#   + features/pricing/dynamic_pricing.feature
#   ~ docs/specs/use-cases.md
#   ~ docs/specs/traceability.md
#   1 added · 2 modified · 9 unchanged

# 2. Apply once you're satisfied
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest specops sync \
  --project-dir ./smart-parking \
  --pack parking-management/backend \
  --pack-version v0.2.0

# 3. Re-validate
npx create-spec-driven-app@latest validate ./smart-parking --strict-tdd

# 4. Commit the updated .specops.lock and the regenerated spec files
git add .specops.lock docs/specs features
git commit -m "chore(specs): bump parking-management/backend to v0.2.0"
```

Plain `sync` (no `--pack` / `--pack-version`) re-expands every pack in the lockfile using the **vars persisted there** — no need to retype `--var` flags.

---

## 11. Close the loop: `plan` → implement → `done`

**Goal:** after a `specops sync` brings new requirements into the project, drive a human or AI agent through the implementation cycle without manually reading every `.feature` file.

```bash
# 1. After sync (or any time), see what's left
csda plan
```

You get a bucketed report:

```
📋 Plan  (12 requirement(s), 3 pending)

  ❌ Needs everything (no test, no code)
    REQ-007    SCN-007
      · feature: features/pricing/dynamic_pricing.feature
      · test:    src/test/.../DynamicPricingTest.java
      · code:    src/main/.../DynamicPricing.java

  ⚠️  Test exists, production code missing
    REQ-008    SCN-008
      ✓ test:    src/test/.../SeasonalRateTest.java
      · code:    src/main/.../SeasonalRateService.java

  ⚠️  Artifacts present — run `csda done <REQ>`
    REQ-009    SCN-009

  Next: read the feature file, write the test, write the code, then run `csda done <REQ-id>`.
```

For AI agents, swap to JSON:

```bash
csda plan --format json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "total": 12,
  "pending": 3,
  "summary": { "NEEDS_EVERYTHING": 1, "NEEDS_IMPLEMENTATION": 1, "NEEDS_STATUS_UPDATE": 1, "DONE": 9 },
  "next_steps": [
    { "requirement": "REQ-007", "category": "NEEDS_EVERYTHING", "hint": "Read features/pricing/dynamic_pricing.feature, then write the test, then the production code." }
  ],
  "requirements": [],
  "orphan_features": []
}
```

### After implementing, mark the REQ done

```bash
csda done REQ-007                          # → Status="Implemented"
csda done REQ-007 --status Verified         # → Status="Verified"
csda done REQ-007 --check                   # runs `validate` first; aborts on red
csda done REQ-007 --strict                  # like --check but uses `validate --strict-tdd`
```

`done` edits exactly one cell in `docs/specs/traceability.md`. Combined with `validate --strict-tdd` in CI, the matrix is the live source of truth instead of a rear-view mirror.

### AI agent recipe (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Aider with MCP)

The MCP server exposes `plan` and `mark_requirement_done`. A canonical prompt:

```
1. Call the `plan` tool with projectDir set to my repo.
2. Pick the first item from next_steps.
3. Read the feature file (using `read_spec` or your editor).
4. Write the test file at the expected path. Run the test — confirm it fails.
5. Write production code until the test passes.
6. Run `validate_project` to confirm gates are green.
7. Call `mark_requirement_done` with that requirement id and check=true.
8. Repeat from step 1 until plan returns pending=0.
```

---

## 12. Change a requirement that already shipped

**Goal:** modify the spec tree of a live project without the matrix, the specs
and the feature files drifting apart. Recipes 2–3 cover writing requirements on
day one; this is the loop for every day after.

### 1. Open the change

```bash
csda change new add-dynamic-pricing
```

```
  ✔ Change add-dynamic-pricing created (lite · REQ ids REQ-014…REQ-016 reserved)

    + docs/specs/changes/add-dynamic-pricing/change.yaml
    + docs/specs/changes/add-dynamic-pricing/proposal.md
    + docs/specs/changes/add-dynamic-pricing/tasks.md
```

The reserved ID range is written into `change.yaml`, so two changes in flight
never hand out the same `REQ-NNN`. Use `--full` instead of the default `--lite`
when the change also needs a `design.md` and contract artefacts.

### 2. Let the tool tell you what to write next

```bash
csda change status
```

```
  add-dynamic-pricing (spec-driven)

    ✔ proposal   proposal.md
    ▶ specs      specs/**/spec.md
    — design     design.md
    ✔ tasks      tasks.md

  Next
    → Write specs/**/spec.md
```

Artefacts are a dependency graph, not a phase gate (ADR-0018): `▶` is what is
ready to write, `—` is not applicable at this rigor level. Nothing blocks you
from writing them out of order.

### 3. Write the delta

Only what moves — never a copy of the whole spec. One file per capability
under `specs/<capability>/spec.md`:

```markdown
# Delta — pricing

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-014 — Dynamic peak pricing

The system SHALL raise the tariff automatically when occupancy crosses a
configured threshold.

#### Scenario: SCN-014 — Peak rate applies above the threshold

- GIVEN occupancy is above 85%
- WHEN a vehicle enters
- THEN the peak tariff is applied

<!-- csda:trace uc=UC-007 cmd=CMD-011 agg=AGG-Pricing evt=EVT-PriceApplied
     feature=features/pricing/dynamic_pricing.feature -->
```

Three sections are valid: `## ADDED Requirements`, `## MODIFIED Requirements`,
`## REMOVED Requirements`. `MODIFIED` replaces the whole requirement block — it
does not merge scenario by scenario.

Two things the validator is strict about:

- **Steps are plain `- GIVEN` bullets.** `- **GIVEN**` fails with
  `scenario_not_gherkin`, because the keyword has to start the line.
- **The body needs an RFC-2119 keyword** (`SHALL` / `MUST` / `SHOULD` / `MAY`),
  otherwise you get `no_rfc2119_keyword`. A requirement that states no
  obligation is not a requirement.

The `csda:trace` comment is optional — it is the bridge to the DDD matrix.
Without it the requirement still archives, with `-` in those columns.

### 4. Validate

```bash
csda change validate add-dynamic-pricing
```

```
  ✔ add-dynamic-pricing (1 delta(s))
```

You rarely need to run this by hand: plain `csda validate` validates every
active change, so a broken delta fails the PR gate on its own. A project with
no `docs/specs/changes/` directory is unaffected.

### 5. Archive it

Archiving is the step that earns the ceremony. Preview first:

```bash
csda change archive add-dynamic-pricing --dry-run
```

```
  Archive plan (dry run — nothing written)

    ~ docs/specs/capabilities/pricing/spec.md (spec)
    ~ docs/specs/traceability.md (traceability)
    → docs/specs/changes/add-dynamic-pricing moves to docs/specs/changes/archive/2026-08-16-add-dynamic-pricing
```

Unchecked tasks block it (`archive_tasks_incomplete`); `--force` overrides.
Then apply:

```bash
csda change archive add-dynamic-pricing --yes
```

```
  ✔ Archived as 2026-08-16-add-dynamic-pricing

    specs:        1 added · 0 modified · 0 removed
    traceability: 1 row(s) added · 0 updated · 0 removed
    features:     0 materialised
```

### 6. The requirement is now real work

The archive merged the delta into `docs/specs/capabilities/pricing/spec.md` and
added the matrix row:

```
| REQ-014 | SCN-014 | `features/pricing/dynamic_pricing.feature` | UC-007 | CMD-011 | AGG-Pricing | EVT-PriceApplied | - | TBD | Draft |
```

`csda plan` lists it as pending immediately. It arrives as `Draft`, which
`--strict-tdd` deliberately tolerates — an accepted proposal is not yet a
commitment to have written the test. The gate bites the moment you start:

```bash
# after moving the row's status to In Dev
csda validate . --strict-tdd
```

```
❌ [ERROR] --strict-tdd violations detected:
  [TDD-1] Test artifact is TBD but status is 'In Dev' (scenario: SCN-014)
💡 [FIX] TDD-1: write the test first, then set its path in the row's 'Test artifact' column (or move the status back to Draft).
```

That is the whole point: a merged proposal cannot quietly become undone work.

### It composes with packs

| You want | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Review an upstream pack bump as intent, not as a file diff | `specops diff --as-change --pack-version v0.2.0` |
| Send a local change back upstream to the pack | `specops contribute --change add-dynamic-pricing` |
| Fail CI when the project has drifted from the locked pack | `validate --against-lock` |

See recipe 10 for the version-bump workflow those hook into.

---

## 13. Wire the MCP server into Claude / Cursor / Aider

**Goal:** let an MCP-aware AI agent read specs, list requirements, and run `validate` directly.

Install:

```bash
npm i -g @spec-driven/mcp-server
```

Claude Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-driven": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@spec-driven/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools exposed by the server:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `read_spec` | Returns `spec.md` and lists every `docs/specs/*.md`. |
| `list_requirements` | Returns every `REQ-NNN` with title, file, and line. |
| `update_traceability` | Idempotently appends a row to `traceability.md`. |
| `lint_pack` | Runs `pack lint` and returns structured errors. |
| `validate_project` | Runs `validate` (or `validate --strict-tdd`) and parses the output. |
| `plan` | Returns the same JSON as `csda plan --format json`. |
| `mark_requirement_done` | Mirrors `csda done <REQ>` (supports `--check`/`--strict`). |

Restart the client; the tools appear in the model's tool list as `spec-driven.*`.

---

## 14. Use the VS Code extension

**Goal:** get inline diagnostics for `pack.yaml`, code-lens to jump to the traceability row, and validate-on-save.

1. Install [`vscode-spec-driven`](../packages/vscode-spec-driven) from the Marketplace (`ext install rsaglobaltech.vscode-spec-driven`).
2. Open a project root. The extension auto-detects `spec.md` / `docs/specs/traceability.md`.
3. Open any `pack.yaml` — diagnostics from the JSON Schema appear in the Problems panel.
4. Hover any `REQ-NNN` (or `UC-`, `SCN-`, `AGG-`, `EVT-`, `RUL-`, `CMD-`) → CodeLens shows "Reveal in traceability".
5. Enable validate-on-save: open settings, search **Spec-Driven**, tick `validateOnSave`. The CLI runs after every save and posts results to the Problems panel.

Settings:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spec-driven.validateOnSave` | `false` | Run `validate` on every file save. |
| `spec-driven.codeLens` | `true` | Show "Reveal in traceability" code lenses. |
| `spec-driven.cliPath` | `npx create-spec-driven-app` | Override if you ship the CLI vendored. |
| `spec-driven.schemaPath` | bundled | Point at a custom `pack.schema.json`. |

## 15. Wire `validate` into a pre-commit hook

**Goal:** block commits that drop a `REQ` without a `.feature` or a `traceability.md` row before they ever leave the developer's machine.

Plain shell (works without husky/lefthook):

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit  (chmod +x)
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
echo "→ csda validate --strict-tdd"
npx --yes create-spec-driven-app@0.1.0 validate . --strict-tdd
echo "→ csda specops diff (must be clean)"
DIFF=$(npx --yes create-spec-driven-app@0.1.0 specops diff --format json 2>/dev/null || true)
if echo "$DIFF" | grep -q '"added":\[\([^]].\)\]\|"modified":\[\([^]].\)\]'; then
  echo "✖ Pack content drifted. Run \`csda specops sync\` and commit again."
  exit 1
fi
```

Or with **husky** (`package.json`):

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky init
echo 'npx --yes create-spec-driven-app@latest validate . --strict-tdd' > .husky/pre-commit
```

Mirror the same call in CI (see §4) so the gate survives `--no-verify`.

## 16. End-to-end walkthrough with `parking-management-specops`

**Goal:** end-to-end exercise using the real demo pack repo at `https://github.com/rsaglobaltech/parking-management-specops`.

```bash
# 0. Pick a working directory
mkdir -p ~/sandbox && cd ~/sandbox

# 1. Generate the consumer project
cat > smart-parking.config <<'EOF'
PROJECT_NAME="Smart Parking"
PROJECT_SLUG="smart-parking"
PROJECT_TYPE="backend"
DOMAIN="parking operations"
STACK="Quarkus 3.x, Java 21, PostgreSQL"
API_STYLE="REST with DTO boundaries"
TESTING="JUnit 5, Testcontainers, Cucumber"
LANG="en"
MODULES=""
EOF

csda init --config ./smart-parking.config --out . --no-git
cd smart-parking

# 2. Apply the parking-management pack (pinned to v0.1.0)
csda specops add \
  --pack-repo https://github.com/rsaglobaltech/parking-management-specops.git \
  --pack-version v0.1.0 \
  --pack backend \
  --var PROJECT_NAME="Smart Parking" \
  --var PROJECT_SLUG=smart-parking \
  --var DOMAIN="parking operations"

# 3. See what work the pack created
csda plan

# 4. (Optional) Same, machine-readable for an AI agent
csda plan --format json | tail -40

# 5. Implement one REQ (this is the "human + AI" loop)
#    Read features/.../*.feature, write the test, write the production code.
#    Then close the loop:
csda done REQ-001 --check        # runs validate first, aborts on red

# 6. When pack v0.2.0 lands upstream, preview the diff before applying
csda specops diff --pack-version v0.2.0
csda specops diff --pack-version v0.2.0 --format json

# 7. Apply the bump
csda specops sync --pack-version v0.2.0
csda plan                         # see what's newly NEEDS_*

# 8. Drop the pack entirely if needed
csda specops remove parking-management/backend
```

Every command above also works **without** flags from inside the project tree (project root auto-detected). For CI, see §4 for the workflow YAML and §14 for the local pre-commit gate.

## 17. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validate` says **"missing traceability.md row"** for a `.feature` you just added | The matrix needs every feature file registered. | Add a row pointing to the relative path of the `.feature`. |
| `validate --strict-tdd` fails on a half-baked REQ | A `REQ-NNN` exists in `spec.md` without a `.feature` or executable test. | Either add the test, or mark the row in `traceability.md` as `Deferred`. |
| `expand` leaves `{{VARS}}` in generated files | A required `--var` was not provided. | Re-run with the missing variable. Check `pack.yaml > variables.required`. |
| `specops sync` rewrites your edits to a generated file | Generated files are meant to be regenerable. | Customise the **pack template**, not the generated output. |
| `pack lint` rejects a pack that worked before | A new schema version added required fields. | Run `npx create-spec-driven-app@latest pack lint …` against the latest CLI to see the actual error. |
| `npx create-spec-driven-app …` hangs the first time | npm is resolving the package. | Subsequent runs are cached; pin the version (e.g. `@0.1.0-beta.3`) in CI. |
| `specops sync` complains "no lockfile and no `specops.config.yaml`" | Neither source of truth is present. | Run `expand` once, **or** create `specops.config.yaml` (see §9). |

Still stuck? Open an issue with the output of `npx create-spec-driven-app@latest validate --help` plus the failing command. The [Comparisons doc](comparisons.md) lists migration paths from `spec-kit`, Cursor rules, Aider conventions, and plain READMEs if the answer is "this tool isn't the right fit".
