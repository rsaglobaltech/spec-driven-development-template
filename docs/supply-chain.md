# Supply chain

A domain pack is a dependency that writes files into your repository. That
makes it the most interesting attack surface this tool has, and the reason the
guarantees below exist. This page covers what is enforced, what is opt-in, and
how to run any of it on a network that cannot reach GitHub.

For reporting a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## What a pack can do

`specgate specops add` clones a pack repository at a pinned tag and renders its
templates into your project. Rendering writes files. It does not execute pack
code — there is no install hook, no lifecycle script, no plugin entry point —
but a malicious pack can still write a `.feature` file, an ADR, or a CI config
your pipeline then runs.

Treat installing a pack the way you treat adding a dependency: from a source
you trust, at a version you pinned.

## Pinning and integrity

Every installed pack is recorded in `.specops.lock` with its repository,
version and a **content digest**: a `sha256` over the pack's file tree, taken
from sorted POSIX-relative paths and file contents, so it is stable across
operating systems and clone order.

Re-installing the same `(repo, pack, version)` recomputes the digest and fails
loudly when it differs:

```
Pack integrity check failed for payments@v1.2.0:
  locked digest:  sha256:9f2c…
  fetched digest: sha256:41ab…
```

That is the signature of a **moved tag**, a rewritten history, or a poisoned
cache — the three ways a version number stops meaning one thing. A version tag
is a label, not a promise; the digest is the promise.

The fix is deliberately manual. Investigate the pack repository first. If the
change is legitimate, re-pin to a new version, or delete the cached copy and
re-run `specops add` to accept the new digest explicitly. Nothing auto-heals,
because auto-healing here means silently accepting substituted content.

## Drift in the other direction

The digest catches the pack changing under a fixed version. `validate
--against-lock` catches the opposite: rendered files in your repository no
longer matching the locked pack.

```bash
specgate validate . --against-lock
```

`specgate ci init` now emits this step for all four providers, guarded on
`.specops.lock` existing so a project without packs is unaffected. If you
generated your gate before this existed, re-run `ci init --stdout` and copy the
`Check pack drift` step across.

## Signed packs

Signature verification uses GPG through git — `git verify-tag`, falling back to
`git verify-commit` for workflows without annotated tags. No new dependency:
organisations that sign already distribute keys through git tooling.

It is **opt-in**, per project:

```yaml
# specops.config.yaml
require_signed_packs: true
```

With that set, an unsigned or unverifiable pack is a hard error.

**It is off by default, and that is deliberate.** Turning it on by default
would break every project installing a pack whose tags are not signed —
including the ten curated packs in this repository. A default that fails on
correct usage teaches people to disable the check, which is worse than not
having it. Turn it on once your organisation signs its own packs; that is when
the check starts distinguishing anything.

## Air-gapped and offline networks

Two independent mechanisms, for two different situations.

**A machine that has the pack cached already.** Packs are cached under
`~/.cache/specgate/packs/<sha256-of-repo>/<version>/`. Setting `CSDA_OFFLINE=1`
makes resolution use the cache and refuse to reach the network:

```bash
CSDA_OFFLINE=1 specgate specops add --pack-repo <url> --pack-version v1.2.0 --pack payments
```

A cache miss is an error naming the exact directory it looked in, rather than a
silent fetch. Use this on CI runners that must not egress.

**A network that has never seen the pack.** Export the pack repository as a git
bundle on a connected machine, carry the single file across, and install from
it — `specops add` accepts a bundle path anywhere it accepts a URL:

```bash
# connected side
specgate pack bundle --repo https://github.com/acme/packs.git --out acme-packs.bundle

# air-gapped side
specgate specops add --pack-repo ./acme-packs.bundle --pack-version v1.2.0 --pack payments
```

The bundle carries full history and tags, so version pinning, digests and
signature verification all still work. Nothing about the security model is
weakened by the transport.

Both paths are worth rehearsing before you need them. A restore procedure that
has never been run is a hope, not a procedure.

## Dependencies of this tool

The published package has **zero runtime dependencies**. Everything in
`package.json` is a devDependency, so nothing in the dependency tree ships to
users.

That is not the same as harmless. A compromised devDependency executes on CI
with a publish token in scope, which is why `npm audit`, CodeQL and Dependabot
all gate the build, and why npm releases carry
[provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements).

### SBOM

A CycloneDX SBOM is generated on every push, pull request and weekly schedule,
and retained for 90 days as the `sbom-cyclonedx` artifact — so an audit can ask
"what was in the tree that day" without reconstructing a historical dependency
graph.

```bash
npm run sbom        # writes sbom.cyclonedx.json
npm run licenses    # SBOM + the licence policy gate
```

It comes from `npm sbom`, not a third-party generator. Adding a dependency to
document having few dependencies would be a poor trade.

### Licence policy

`scripts/license_check.ts` fails the build when any component carries a licence
outside an allow-list of permissive terms. Dual licences (`MIT OR CC0-1.0`)
pass when either side is allowed; `AND` expressions require every term.

The tree today — 377 components, all permissive, no copyleft:

| Licence | Components |
| --- | --: |
| MIT | 288 |
| Apache-2.0 | 33 |
| ISC | 27 |
| BSD-3-Clause | 9 |
| BSD-2-Clause | 7 |
| BlueOak-1.0.0 | 5 |
| MIT OR CC0-1.0 | 3 |
| Python-2.0 · CC-BY-4.0 · CC-BY-3.0 · CC0-1.0 · 0BSD | 1 each |

The unusual four are worth naming, because "we allow CC-BY" reads alarming
without them: `argparse` is Python-2.0, `caniuse-lite` is CC-BY-4.0 over a
browser-support **dataset**, and `spdx-exceptions` / `spdx-license-ids` are
CC-BY-3.0 and CC0-1.0 over lists of licence identifiers. All four are data or
tooling, none imposes an obligation on distributing this CLI.

A copyleft licence is not banned so much as undecided: allowing one silently
would skip the review of what it obliges. If you need to add a licence, add it
to `ALLOWED` in `scripts/license_check.ts` and say why here — the allow-list and
its justification stay in the same change.

## What this does not do

`specgate validate` is a specification gate, not a security scanner. It checks that
requirements have scenarios, tests and traceability rows. It will not tell you
your application has an injection flaw, and it never claims to.
