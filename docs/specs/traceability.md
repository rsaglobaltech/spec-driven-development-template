# Traceability Matrix — `create-spec-driven-app` CLI

> Links every CLI requirement to its scenario, feature file, implementation and
> test. All requirement IDs reference [`/spec.md`](../../spec.md).
>
> **This is the rich 10-column format the CLI generates for user projects** —
> the tool has to be able to operate on its own repository, and
> `csda change archive` rewrites the table below. `tests/unit/docs-truth.test.ts`
> fails the build if any path named here stops existing.
>
> Columns the CLI's own domain does not use (`Use Case`, `Command/Query`,
> `Aggregate`, `Event`) carry `-`. Bounded contexts live in [`/spec.md`](../../spec.md) §7.
>
> **Supporting sections avoid 3-, 4- and 10-column pipe tables.** The matrix
> parser reads any table of that shape as matrix rows and takes its first column
> for Scenario IDs, which trips the duplicate-ID check. §2 is a 5-column table
> and coexists fine; §3 and §4 are lists because they would not.

**REQ-008 is the one row that is honest about being unfinished.** The composite
action in `actions/spec-driven-action/` is exercised by nothing — a broken step
would ship unnoticed. It stays `Draft` with a `TBD` test until C6-08 covers it,
which is exactly what `--strict-tdd` is designed to tolerate: an acknowledged
gap, not a hidden one.

## 2. Non-functional requirements

| NFR | Requirement | Quality attribute | Measured by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-001 | `init` to green `validate` ≤ 60 s on clean env | Performance | Not measured automatically; `npm run smoke:init` is manual and not run by CI | Draft |
| NFR-002 | Unit coverage ≥ 80 % lines / ≥ 70 % branches | Reliability | `c8 --check-coverage` in CI. **Today: 74.8 % lines · 71.1 % branches · 80.4 % functions**, gated at 74/70/80. Branches and functions meet the target; lines does not | In Dev |
| NFR-003 | Zero ESLint errors and zero Prettier diffs on `main` | Maintainability | CI `lint` job: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format:check` | Verified |
| NFR-004 | CLI emits structured JSON for agents via `--json` | Usability | `change --json` and `plan --format json` only. Whole-surface coverage is C3-02 | In Dev |
| NFR-005 | Every shipped `pack.yaml` passes schema and lint checks in CI | Reliability | `npm run registry:build` lints all 11 packs in `packs/` and exits 1 on failure | Verified |

> **NFR-003 changed meaning.** It used to promise "zero ShellCheck warnings".
> ADR-0008 removed every shell script from the CLI, so there is nothing for
> ShellCheck to lint but the demo recording scripts. Adding that step is C6-05.

## 3. Test inventory

- **`tests/cli.test.ts`** — E2E / integration, `node:test`. Covers REQ-001,
  REQ-005 and REQ-012: dispatch, dry-run, the runtime contract, harness CI mode.
- **`tests/unit/`** — unit, `node:test` via `scripts/run-tests.cjs`. Covers
  REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-006, REQ-007 and REQ-010 through REQ-015.
- **`tests/snapshot/init-determinism.test.ts`** — snapshot, `node:test`. Covers REQ-009.
- **`features/cli/` and `features/pack/`** — BDD, 22 Cucumber scenarios. Covers REQ-001 to REQ-004.
- **`packages/*/test/unit/`** — unit, `node:test`. VS Code extension, MCP server,
  pack registry and LSP server.
- **`tests/unit/docs-truth.test.ts`** — guard. Every path named in this file must exist.

## 4. Coverage gaps (open work)

- **P0 — REQ-008 has no test at all.** The composite action in
  `actions/spec-driven-action/` is exercised by nothing. _(C6-08)_
- **P0 — `--json` covers 2 commands of ~20.** _(C3-02)_
- **P1 — NFR-002 target not met.** Lines at 74.8 % against a target of 80 %. The
  gate is real, but ratcheted at 74. _(C6-01)_
- **P2 — NFR-001 is unmeasured.** No automated timing of `init` → green
  `validate`. _(C6-08)_
- **P2 — ShellCheck is not in CI**, though `CONTRIBUTING.md` used to claim it
  was. _(C6-05)_
