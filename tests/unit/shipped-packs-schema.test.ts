/**
 * Every pack this repository ships, validated against the schema that claims to

 *
 * ## Why this file did not exist, and had to
 *
 * ADR-0020 says it plainly: *"`schemas/pack.schema.json` is the single
 * authority. The validator, the installer, `pack init` and every shipped pack
 * conform to it."* Measured before writing this, ten of the eleven curated packs
 * failed that schema — while all eleven passed `pack lint --strict`.
 *
 * `tests/unit/pack-schema.test.ts` already validated against the schema, and
 * looked like the check that would have caught this. It validates **one fixture
 * pack**. The packs actually shipped were read by nobody. That is the same shape
 * as H14: a check that exists, appears to cover something, and is pointed
 * somewhere else.
 *
 * So this walks `packs/**` and validates what really goes out. A schema declared
 * the authority and enforced against nothing is a document, not a gate.

// ── What the mismatch actually cost (E1) ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// H13 read like a paperwork problem: a schema declaring authority it did not
// exercise. Measuring it turned up something worse. The schema said `context`
// and `invariants`, the packs write `bounded_context` and `responsibilities`,
// and the renderer read the schema's names — so installing any curated pack
// produced domain documents with empty columns:
//
//     | AGG-001 | Invoice | - | - |
//     | EVT-001 | InvoiceIssued | - | - | invoiceId: string, … |
//
// Not a red test. A worse product, shipped, for every pack.
