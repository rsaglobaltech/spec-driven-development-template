/**
 * Issue #121: the Docker image build went from 3 minutes to a 28-minute
 * cancel between 0.6.0 and 0.7.0.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: tsconfig.json's include list covers the whole
 * tests directory, the whole features directory, and every package's own
 * test directory, because the same config also drives "npm run test:unit"
 * outside Docker — but none of that ships in the npm tarball (see
 * package.json's "files" list), so compiling and packing it inside
 * Dockerfile.cli's build stage was pure waste. The 0.6.0 to 0.7.0 cycle
 * added roughly 290 files and 35k lines, almost entirely tests, and that
 * waste is what the arm64 leg paid for twice over — once at native cost,
 * and again multiplied by QEMU's emulation penalty on the amd64 CI runner.
 *
 * These tests pin the fix's two halves so neither can silently regress:
 * Dockerfile.cli no longer copies the top-level test directories in, and
 * .dockerignore excludes them — including each package's own test
 * directory, which the Dockerfile still bulk-copies as part of "packages".
