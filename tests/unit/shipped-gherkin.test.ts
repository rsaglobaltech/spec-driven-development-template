/**
 * Every Gherkin file this repository ships, parsed by Cucumber's own parser.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (H14)
 *
 * 27 of the 28 scenarios in `packs/**` had **zero steps** as far as Cucumber was
 * concerned. The templates wrote their keywords in upper case:
 *
 *     Scenario: Evaluation respects rollout percentage
 *       GIVEN a flag with 50% rollout in production
 *       WHEN 100 users are evaluated
 *       THEN approximately half receive value=true
 *
 * **Gherkin keywords are case-sensitive.** `GIVEN` is not a keyword, so the real
 * parser absorbed those three lines as the scenario's *description*. No syntax
 * error, no warning: the scenario exists and is empty. And an empty scenario
 * passes — `1 scenario (1 passed) · 0 steps · exit 0`.
 *
 * That is H1 wearing a different coat. H1 was "the gate did not run the scenario
 * it was supervising"; this was "the scenario it supervises contains nothing to
 * run". Every project seeded with `specgate specops add` inherited a reward signal
 * that approves anything, and the harness driving those requirements was not
 * verifying — it was signing.
 *
 * Our own linter agreed everything was fine, because `pack lint` matches
 * `/(Given|When|Then|And|But)/i` — case-insensitively. It saw three steps where
 * Cucumber saw none. A linter that approves what the runner ignores is worse
 * than no linter: it grants a guarantee that does not exist.
 *
 * ## Why it is written against the reference parser
 *
 * The defect was invisible to three hand-written parsers in this repository and
 * obvious to `@cucumber/gherkin`, which is already a devDependency. Checking
 * shipped Gherkin with anything other than the parser that will actually run it
 * is how this happened, so this test imports the real one and no other.
