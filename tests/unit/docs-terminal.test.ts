/**
 * The recorded terminal on the landing page.
 *
 * ## What is being protected
 *
 * The page says, in as many words, "this is what it actually prints". For a
 * project whose whole thesis is that a specification must not be able to
 * quietly become false, a marketing claim that can quietly become false is the
 * worst thing on the site.
 *
 * The full defence is `npm run docs:terminal:check`, which re-runs the CLI and
 * diffs. That takes half a minute and a build, and it fails on exactly the
 * pull requests that *should* change the output — which is how a guard becomes
 * a reflex nobody reads. So it runs nightly and at release, and what runs on
 * every commit is this file: cheap invariants that catch the drift that
 * actually matters — a recording from the wrong version, a command the CLI no
 * longer has, a flag that was renamed, a fallback that fell out of sync.
 *
 * Nothing here executes the CLI.
