/**
 * One `git worktree add` at a time, across processes.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `--concurrency` runs each requirement in its own **process**, and every one
 * of them creates a worktree in the same repository. Git writes
 * `.git/worktrees/<name>/` incrementally — `gitdir`, then `commondir`, then the
 * rest — and a sibling `git worktree add` scanning that directory can read an
 * entry that is half there:
 *
 * ```
 * fatal: failed to read .git/worktrees/csda-harness-REQ-000-b300c79f/commondir:
 *        Undefined error: 0
 * ```
 *
 * Observed on CI on both macOS and Ubuntu, roughly one run in three. It is the
 * same family as the `git worktree prune` race the parent already avoids by
 * pruning once before anything is created — that one was fixed, this one was
 * not.
 *
 * The failure is worse than a crash, because it is *attributed*: the run
 * reports the requirement as `fail` with "the agent produced no files", so a
 * race in the harness reads as the agent's fault.
 *
 * ## Why a lock directory
 *
 * `mkdir` either creates or fails, atomically, on every platform this runs on —
 * no `O_EXCL` flag juggling and nothing to clean up if the process dies holding
 * a file handle. The pid and timestamp inside make a stale lock diagnosable
 * rather than mysterious.
 *
 * ## Why only around `add`
 *
 * The lock covers creating the worktree and nothing else. The agent, the gate
 * and the tests — the parts that take minutes — stay parallel, so the ceiling
 * on throughput is unchanged. `git worktree add` on a warm repository takes
 * tens of milliseconds.
