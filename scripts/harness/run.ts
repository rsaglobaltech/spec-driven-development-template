 * The command lives in `scripts/cli/commands/harness/RunCommand`; command
 * substitution, the gate-output hint and the dependency scheduling are domain
 * (`core/domain/HarnessRun`), which is what lets the scheduler be tested
 * without a git repository and an agent. Kept as one import site for
 * `harness report` and the run tests.
