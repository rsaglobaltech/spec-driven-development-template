/**
 * The dependency graph between requirements.
 *
 * `harness run` processed requirements in matrix order and cut every worktree
 * from the same base, which is wrong whenever one requirement builds on
 * another: REQ-002 needed REQ-001's code to exist and there was no way to say
 * so, so somebody had to know it and pass `--base-branch` by hand. That is
 * defect H12 of the closure plan, and the false failure recorded as H9 was the
 * same gap seen from the other side.
 *
 * A requirement declares what it builds on inside the `csda:trace` comment it
 * already carries:
 *
 *   <!-- csda:trace uc=UC-002 feature=features/auth/scopes.feature
 *        depends=REQ-001 -->
 *
 * That comment is the repository's existing way of attaching machine-readable
 * facts to a requirement, and `change archive` already reads it to write the
 * traceability row. So the model is the one this repository uses everywhere
 * else: **the requirement declares, the matrix reflects.** Nothing about the
 * ten-column format changes, which matters — `done` and `alm sync` both read
 * Status as the penultimate cell, so an extra column would have silently sent
 * status writes to the wrong place.
 *
 * A missing declaration means no dependencies, so every project that never
 * writes one behaves exactly as it does today.
