 *
 * Which artefacts exist is a house style, not a law: the graph comes from the
 * change's declared schema (`schema:` in `change.yaml`), so a team can fork
 * `bdd-first` — scenario before spec — or write its own. The semantics do not
 * change with it. Dependencies are enablers, not gates (ADR-0018): `blocked`
 * means "you have not written what this builds on yet", never "you are
