/**
 * GitHub Issues.
 *
 * The unit is a **repository**, not a project, which is why this provider
 * declares `repo` rather than reusing `project_key`. Writing
 * `project_key: acme/widgets` would read as a lie, and the config contract
 * exists precisely so a provider can say what it actually needs.
 *
 * There is no `issue_type`: GitHub has labels, and the connector applies the
 * same two every other provider does. There is no `done_state` either — an
 * issue is open or closed — and declaring one would be read by nobody, which
 * is the defect `done_state` on Jira already was.
 *
 * **Closed is not always done.** GitHub distinguishes closing an issue as
 * `completed` from closing it as `not_planned`, and only the first means the
 * work happened. Collapsing both to "done" would tell the traceability matrix
 * a requirement was delivered when the team had in fact abandoned it — so
 * `not_planned` reads as open, and the mismatch surfaces as drift for a human,
 * which is what ADR-0021 asks for.
