// Two tiers, because the alternative is worse in both directions. Every
// connector is somebody else's API, changing on their schedule; carrying six of
// them here would make this repository's release cadence hostage to six
// vendors. Refusing them all would make the tool useless to a team on YouTrack.
//
// So: `jira`, `azure` and `github` are core — maintained here, exercised by the
// conformance kit in CI. Anything else is resolved by package name:
//
//     provider: npm:csda-alm-youtrack
//
// **This runs third-party code, and that code is handed your ALM credential**,
// because a connector cannot talk to a board without one. The trust model is
// therefore exactly that of a devDependency, and the guards below are the ones
// that make it no worse than that:
//
//   - nothing is ever installed automatically. The package must already be in
//     the project's `node_modules`, which means somebody added it deliberately
//     and it went through whatever review dependencies get;
//   - the name must be a package name — no paths, no URLs, no `..`. A config
//     file cannot be made to load an arbitrary file off the disk;
//   - the module is checked against the port before a single method is called,
//     so a package that is not a provider fails with a diagnostic rather than a
//     stack trace from inside `sync`.
