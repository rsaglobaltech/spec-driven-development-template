 * Client construction, resolved through the provider registry.

 * This file used to *be* the two connectors, selected by a ternary on
 * `cfg.provider`. The connectors now live in `providers/` behind the
 * `AlmProvider` port (see `port.ts` for why), and what is left here is the
 * lookup plus the names the rest of the tree already imports.
 *
 * A client carries its provider's capabilities, because the core has to know
 * what an ALM cannot do — `syncRequirements` reports a requirement it cannot
 * close rather than throwing — and the client is the only thing it holds.
