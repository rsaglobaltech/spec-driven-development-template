/**
 * `AlmProvider` — the contract every ALM connector implements.
 *
 * The two connectors that existed before this module were a ternary in
 * `clients.ts` over `provider === "jira"`, which scales to two and no further.
 * Worse, nothing recorded *which configuration keys each provider reads*, and
 * three consequences of that shipped:
 *
 *   1. a Jira config with no `user_env` passes validation and fails later with
 *      "Environment variable JIRA_USER is not set" — a variable the file never
 *      named;
 *   2. `alm.config.yaml` accepts any key at all, so `nonsense_key: 42` and a
 *      `user_env` on an Azure config are read by nobody and reported by
 *      nobody. `harness.config.yaml` takes the opposite position, in this same
 *      repository, and says why: a key nobody reads is worse than a missing
 *      one, because the file looks configured;
 *   3. `done_state` is read by Azure and ignored by Jira, which discovers the
 *      transition from the workflow. Setting it on a Jira project does
 *      nothing, silently.
 *
 * So a provider declares three things, and each is read by something:
 *
 *   `config`        which keys it requires and which it merely accepts.
 *                   `lintAlmConfig` reports the rest.
 *   `capabilities`  which operations it can perform. `syncRequirements`
 *                   degrades instead of throwing when one is missing.
 *   `create`        the factory, taking the validated config and a fetch
 *                   implementation so every provider is testable offline.
 *
 * The declaration is not decoration: `tests/unit/alm-conformance.test.ts`
 * runs the same suite against every registered provider and fails when an
 * implementation and its declaration disagree.
