/**
 * The git merge driver for `docs/specs/traceability.md`.
 *
 * ## What git does with this file
 *
 * Git calls a merge driver as a plain process, with three temporary files:
 *
 *     merge-traceability.js %O %A %B
 *                           │  │  └── theirs: the branch being merged in
 *                           │  └───── ours: the current version, AND the file
 *                           │              the driver must overwrite with the
 *                           │              result. Git reads the answer back
 *                           │              out of this path.
 *                           └──────── base: the common ancestor. Git passes an
 *                                     empty file when there is none.
 *
 * Exit 0 means "merged, use %A". A non-zero exit means "conflict" — git keeps
 * whatever %A now contains, which is why the markers are written into it before
 * exiting 1, and marks the path unmerged so `git status` lists it.
 *
 * ## Wiring it up
 *
 * Two halves, and only one of them is committed:
 *
 *   1. `.gitattributes`, in the repository:
 *          docs/specs/traceability.md merge=csda-matrix
 *
 *   2. git config, which is **local to each clone**:
 *          git config merge.csda-matrix.name "csda traceability matrix merge"
 *          git config merge.csda-matrix.driver "node <path>/merge-traceability.js %O %A %B"
 *
 * `specgate harness init` writes both. A fresh clone has only the first, and git
 * then falls back to its built-in line merge — the conflict you would have had
 * anyway. That fallback is why this can be rolled out gradually: an unconfigured
 * checkout is no worse off, never silently wrong. `specgate doctor` reports the
 * gap rather than leaving it to be discovered mid-merge.
 *
 * The decision itself is not here. `mergeTraceability` is domain, pure, and
 * tested without git; this file is the process boundary and nothing else.
