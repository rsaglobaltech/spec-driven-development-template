/**
 * Route 2 of the three-way resolution for a declared-value divergence
 * (§8.6 → §11): "update the spec". Routes 1 ("fix the code") and 3 ("retire
 * the requirement") need no new tooling — they are pointed at from the
 * report and use `change new`/manual editing exactly as they already do.
 * This is the one route that is glue between pieces that already exist:
 * `csda report` finds the divergence, `renderRequirement` already knows how
 * to serialise a requirement node, and `ArchiveChangeUseCase` already knows
 * how to apply a `MODIFIED Requirements` delta.
 *
 * The `value_<id>` trace key is rewritten to the code's value — that part is
 * exact, because it is a structured field. The prose is **not**
 * rewritten automatically: "the session times out after 15 minutes" cannot
 * be turned into "after 30 minutes" without risking a sentence that reads
 * wrong, which is exactly the kind of guess this project refuses to make on
 * a human's behalf. A `TODO:` marks it instead — the same restraint
 * `pack infer` already uses for whatever it cannot infer (ADR-0014).
