/**
 * Which agent profile a requirement gets (D1).
 *
 * ## Why per requirement and not per run
 *
 * `agent_profile` resolves one profile for the whole run, so an infrastructure
 * requirement and a domain one get the same prompt prefix and the same allowed
 * tools. The tool allowances then have to be the greatest common denominator of
 * everything in the plan — a domain requirement carrying `Bash(terraform:*)`
 * because some other requirement needed it.
 *
 * ## The criterion, and what it cost to find
 *
 * The proposal named the bounded context, "which is already in the model". It
 * is in the *pack* model; it was not reachable from a requirement. Measured
 * across the eleven curated packs: **zero of twenty-seven scenarios** link to
 * an aggregate, directly or through their use case, so matching on it would
 * have matched nothing and fallen through to the default every time — a feature
 * that looks like it works and does nothing.
 *
 * The link does exist, one step further round: use case → command → aggregate →
 * bounded context resolves for **all twenty-seven**. So `expand` derives it and
 * writes it beside the matrix, and this module matches on what is written.
 *
 * ## First match wins
 *
 * Order in the file is the priority, which is what makes a `"*"` catch-all at
 * the end read the way people expect. No match is not an error: the run's
 * default profile applies, exactly as before this existed.
