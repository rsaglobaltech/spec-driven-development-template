/**
 * Turning a board issue into a proposal a human can review.
 *
 * ADR-0021 fixes the shape of this: an ALM issue never becomes a matrix row.
 * It becomes a `change` — a proposal and a delta — which then passes through
 * `change validate` and `change archive` like any change written by hand. The
 * board is a mirror, and a mirror does not get to define a requirement.
 *
 * **The scenarios are left empty on purpose, and that is the whole design.**
 * A Jira ticket has a title, a description and a status. It does not contain an
 * executable acceptance criterion, and deriving Gherkin from prose would be
 * inventing the one thing the spec exists to pin down. The empty scenario is
 * not an unfinished feature: it is the marker for the only work that cannot be
 * automated, and `change validate` will refuse the change until a person — or
 * the `spec-author` role — fills it in.
 *
 * Pure: an issue in, markdown out. Reading the board is the provider's job and
 * writing the folder is the change lifecycle's, which is also what keeps the
 * ALM subsystem free of any write path into the spec tree.
