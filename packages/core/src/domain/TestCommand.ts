/**
 * One answer to "how does this project run its tests" (Fase 2.3).
 *
 * There were two, and they disagreed on the same `pom.xml`: `onboard`/`adopt`
 * said `./mvnw -B test`, `harness init` wrote `mvn -B test`. A cold evaluator
 * found it by running both and noticing the mismatch, which is a bad way to
 * learn that a tool has two opinions about your project.
 *
 * The wrapper wins, and not by coin toss. The harness runs each attempt in a
 * bare git worktree; `./mvnw` and `./gradlew` are checked into the repository
 * and work there, while `mvn` and `gradle` depend on what happens to be
 * installed on the machine. Preferring the wrapper is the difference between a
 * gate that runs and a gate that reports "command not found" as a failed
 * attempt and burns one of the agent's three tries on it.
