/**
 * The one diagnostic envelope every machine-readable surface of the CLI emits.
 *
 *   { severity, code, message, target?, fix?, file?, line? }
 *
 * `code` is a stable snake_case string — callers (CI, agents, the VS Code
 * extension) branch on it, never on the message text. `fix` is one actionable
 * sentence or command; a diagnostic without a fix is a diagnostic the user
 * cannot act on, so treat writing one as part of writing the check.
 *
 * Casing is camelCase everywhere in JSON output, decided once here so we do not
 * inherit the snake/camel split that OpenSpec documents as a known defect.
 *
 * This module is the envelope and nothing else: no colours, no streams, no
 * `process`. Rendering a diagnostic for a terminal is a delivery concern and
 * lives in `scripts/lib/diagnostics`, which re-exports everything here.
