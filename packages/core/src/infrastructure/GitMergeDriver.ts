/**
 * Three-way merge primitive for `specops sync`.
 *
 * Given the common ancestor (`base` — what the pack rendered last sync),
 * the working copy (`local` — what is in the project now, possibly
 * hand-edited) and the new render (`incoming` — what the pack renders at
 * the target version), produce a merged result.
 *
 * Delegates to `git merge-file`, which is always available wherever the
 * CLI runs (the project is a git repo by construction). `git merge-file`
 * exit codes: 0 = clean, N>0 = number of conflict regions, <0 = error.
 *
 * Pure-ish: writes only to a throwaway temp dir, never to the project.
