/**
 * Packs that distribute changes.
 *
 * A pack can ship a `changes/` directory alongside its templates. On `sync`
 * those land in the project as **proposed** changes — never applied, never
 * archived. The consuming team reviews and archives them like any other
 * change, which is what keeps the pack from silently rewriting a project's
 * specification.
 *
 * It also gives the pack a semantic changelog: `changes/archive/` upstream is
 * the record of what each version actually decided, in requirements rather
 * than in commit messages.
 *
 * Deliberately additive and non-destructive: an existing change folder in the
 * project is never touched. A pack cannot clobber local work in flight.
