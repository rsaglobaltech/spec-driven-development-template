/**
 * Is this requirement fit to hand to an agent? (B2)
 *
 * `plan` has always known that a requirement's feature does not exist;
 * `harness run` never used it as a filter, so the agent found out halfway
 * through and the run spent `max_attempts` × the timeout discovering it. What
 * this changes is that "ready for an agent?" stops being the intuition of
 * whoever typed the command.
 *
 * The line worth holding is which checks *block*. A blocker means the agent
 * cannot succeed — not that the row is untidy.
