/**
 * A ceiling on what one run may spend (C1).
 *
 * `max_attempts` was the only limit the harness had. Fourteen requirements ×
 * 3 attempts × 1200 s is hours of wall-clock and an unbounded bill, and the
 * third real run ended because the account hit its monthly limit — the
 * expensive way to discover there was no ceiling of our own.
 *
 * The behaviour worth pinning is that exhausting a budget is not an error. A
 * run that dies halfway never writes its ledger, so `harness report` cannot say
 * what the money bought; a run that stops reports what it did.
