/**
 * Picking a run back up where it stopped (C3).
 *
 * The design was measured, not assumed: a run was killed with `kill -9` and the
 * remains inspected. The run ledger was empty — it is written when a run
 * finishes, and `--resume` exists for the runs that do not. What survived was
 * the branch, the worktree with uncommitted partial work, and the prompt
 * archive, whose filenames carry the attempt number.
 *
 * That makes the archive filename format load-bearing for resume, which is why
 * it is pinned here rather than left as an implementation detail somebody
 * tidies later.
