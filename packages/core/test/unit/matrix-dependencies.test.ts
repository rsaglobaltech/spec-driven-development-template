/**
 * `depends_on`, carried from a pack to the project (B1).
 *
 * A pack's requirements do not arrive as capability specs — the capability
 * document each pack ships is its own template — so they land in the
 * traceability matrix, and that is where a pack's `depends_on` has to arrive
 * too.
 *
 * It cannot ride in a cell. The row parser splits on `|` and requires exactly
 * ten cells, so anything appended to a row makes an eleventh and the row stops
 * parsing: the annotation would survive one write and vanish on the next
 * `expand`. On its own line beneath the table it is ignored by the row parser
 * by construction, which is the difference between round-trip safety and
 * round-trip carefulness.
