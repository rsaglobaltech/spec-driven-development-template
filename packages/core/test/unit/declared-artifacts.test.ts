/**
 * The green diff must touch what the matrix declared (A2).
 *
 * A row names `test_artifact` and `technical_artifact`; the prompt hands both
 * to the agent; nothing checked the diff contained them. An agent can implement
 * elsewhere, pass the scenario, and leave the matrix pointing at a file where
 * the logic does not live — the documentary lie `AI_RULES.md` forbids.
 *
 * Most of these tests are about *not* firing. A real matrix cell is markdown
 * written by a person, and the scaffolded one says `` `API /health`, smoke
 * test ``. A check that treats prose as a path reports every project as broken,
 * and a warning that is usually wrong is a warning people learn to ignore —
 * which is how `--strict`-only rules ended up useless in H14.
