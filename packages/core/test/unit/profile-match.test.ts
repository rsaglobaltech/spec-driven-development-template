/**
 * Which agent profile a requirement gets (D1).
 *
 * `agent_profile` resolved one profile for the whole run, so the allowed tools
 * had to be the greatest common denominator of everything in the plan — a
 * domain requirement carrying `Bash(terraform:*)` because some other
 * requirement needed it.
 *
 * The criterion took measuring. The proposal named the bounded context, "which
 * is already in the model": it is in the *pack* model and was not reachable
 * from a requirement — zero of the twenty-seven scenarios across the curated
 * packs link to an aggregate. Matching on it would have matched nothing, every
 * time, and quietly used the default. So `expand` derives it now and these
 * rules match what is written.
